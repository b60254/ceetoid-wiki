# Ranked vs. Practice (Unranked) Mode

Cytoid can be played in either ranked or practice (unranked) mode. Ranked
plays appear on leaderboards and your profile and can contribute to your
rating (rt). Ranked also features stricter timing windows and scoring than
practice mode. Experience earned in practice mode is halved compared to ranked.

## Toggling Practice Mode

Practice mode can be turned on or off by tapping the gamepad button after
selecting a chart.

## Timing Window Comparison

The following table compares the timing windows between the two
modes. (Note: some note types have different timing windows.)

All times are in milliseconds.

| Grade   | Ranked      | Practice    |
| ------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| perfect | \[-40, 40\] | (-70, 70)   |
| great   | (-70, 70)   | (-200, 150) |
| good    | (-200, 150) | (-400, 200) |
| bad     | (-400, 200) | (-800, 300) |
